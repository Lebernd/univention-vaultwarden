# Univention Matterbridge app

Will be worked on every once in a while. Contributions welcome!

This is Bitwarden server API implementation written in rust compatible with [upstream Bitwarden clients](https://bitwarden.com/#download)*, ideal for self-hosted deployment where running official resource-heavy service might not be ideal.

App is based on [Rust implementation of Bitwarden API](https://github.com/dani-garcia/bitwarden_rs).

_*Note, that this project is not associated with the [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) project nor 8bit Solutions LLC._
